Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
- Software Engineering is the use of engineering principles, methods and tools to design, develop, test, deploy and maintain high-quality software systems.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
- Development of programming languages. Languages such as Fortran and C were developed and made it possible to create softwares such as operating systems.
- Software Engineering as a discipline. As of the 1960's people studied software engineering as a profession.
- Rise of Agile Methodologies. Around the 2000's creative Agile methodologies were realised improving on how software systems were built.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements: 
Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
2. Design:
Crafting high-level and detailed designs of both software architecture and user interface.
4. Implementation: 
Coding and building the software in accordance with the system requirements specification and system design.
5. Testing: 
Testing the software to ensure it works, meets the users needs and quality standards.
6. Deployment: 
Rolling out the tested software system to production for the users.
7. Maintenance: 
Providing ongoing support on issues arising, updates and enhancements to the software system after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
- Waterfall methodology is sequential with distinct phases that include requirements to deployment and maintenance cascading downwards like a waterfall while 
while Agile methodology is iterative and incremental focusing on flexibility, collaboration and responding to emerging changes. Waterfall methodology is
suitable when the scope and requirements of the project are well defined and not likely to change while Agile is suitable when there are changing requirements and continuous stakeholder feedback is required.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
- Software Developer: Writes code and implements software solutions
- Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures quality of software by designing and implementing test plans.
- Project Manager: Leads and oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
